A React-based project bootstrapped and developed using Parcel for bundling. This project demonstrates modern React development practices with interactive UI components.


---

## Features

- Interactive UI components
- Responsive design
- State management with React hooks
- Fast development using Parcel

---

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

```bash
node -v
npm -v
````

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FingNaresh/namaste-react.git
cd namaste-react
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Available Scripts

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in **development mode** using Parcel.

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser. The app supports **hot module replacement**, so changes reload automatically.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `dist` folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

The output is optimized and minified for best performance.

#### `npm run serve`

Serves the production build locally (requires `serve` package):

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve dist
```
